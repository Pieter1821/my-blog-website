# Styling in Astro

*Published on: 2024-08-19*

In this post, we'll explore different ways to style your Astro components. Styling is an essential part of web development, and Astro provides several options to make your components look great.

## Using CSS

The simplest way to style your components is by using CSS. You can include CSS directly in your `.astro` files:

```astro
---
// src/components/StyledComponent.astro
const message = "Styled with CSS!";
---
<style>
  .message {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 2em;
  }
</style>
<div class="message">
  <h1>{message}</h1>
</div>
```

## Using CSS Modules

Astro also supports CSS Modules, which allow you to scope your styles locally to the component:

```astro
---
// src/components/StyledComponent.module.css
.message {
  color: green;
  font-size: 2em;
}
---
// src/components/StyledComponent.astro
import styles from './StyledComponent.module.css';
const message = "Styled with CSS Modules!";
---
<div class={styles.message}>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
</div>
```
