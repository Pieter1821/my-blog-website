# My First Blog Post

*Published on: 2024-08-05*

Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my journey as I build a new website using Astro. I'm excited to document my progress and share what I learn along the way.

## What I've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: I started by creating a new Astro project and setting up my online accounts. The installation process was straightforward, and I was up and running in no time.

2. **Creating Pages**: Next, I learned how to create pages by adding new `.astro` files to the `src/pages/` folder. This step was crucial in understanding how Astro handles routing and page generation.

3. **Writing Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I've successfully set up Astro pages and Markdown posts, making it easy to write and manage content.

## What's Next

I plan to complete the Astro tutorial and continue adding more posts. Stay tuned for more updates as I explore the capabilities of Astro and share my findings.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment below. Watch this space for more to come!
