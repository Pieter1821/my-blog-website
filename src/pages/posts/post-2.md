# Understanding Astro Components

*Published on: 2024-08-12*

In this post, we'll take a closer look at Astro components. Components are the building blocks of any Astro project, allowing you to create reusable pieces of UI.

## What Are Astro Components?

Astro components are `.astro` files that can contain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. They are designed to be highly reusable and can be used to build complex UIs.

## Creating Your First Component

To create a component, simply add a new `.astro` file to the `src/components/` directory. Here's an example:

```
---
// src/components/MyComponent.astro
const message = "Hello, Astro!";
---
<div>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
</div>
